As I was evaluating tailwind I there was one thing that pushed me over the edge -- **intellisense**.
The speed that I can go writing styles for my components, it was bliss. Though once I used other libraries like
[clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) or [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.dev/) I kinda got annoyed by the lack of intellisense. It wasn't _that_ bad, but enough to bug me.

For example HeadlessUI's Transition component:

Or the clsx library:

![clsx Without Intellisense](/blog/get-tailwind-intellisense-anywhere/sad_clsx.png)

so the question is:

## How to get intellisense?

Luckily after some searching I found out how.

First go open your workspace settings.

![Command Palette](/blog/get-tailwind-intellisense-anywhere/cmd_palette.png)

This will create a `settings.json` file under a `.vscode` folder if you don't already have one. You can define rules within it. The one we're interested about is `tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex`.

In this we define an array of arrays containing regex to match a pattern.

For example using the clsx library:

```json
{
  "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
    ["clsx\\(([^)]*)\\)", "(?:'|\"|`)([^']*)(?:'|\"|`)"]
  ]
}
```

Let's review what happened there.

The first item in the array is an expression to the **container**, and the second expression is to match the **class lists**.

![Container and Class Lists](/blog/get-tailwind-intellisense-anywhere/container_classlists.png)

**NOTE: Both expressions must contain only one capture group.**

---

If you only have a single class list like the HeadlessUI example, you can specify a single regular expression.

```json
{
  "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
    "(?:enter|leave)(?:From|To)?=\\s*(?:\"|')([^(?:\"|')]*)"
  ]
}
```

You can also use multiple expressions for different contexts

```json
{
  "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
    ["clsx\\(([^)]*)\\)", "(?:'|\"|`)([^']*)(?:'|\"|`)"],
    "(?:enter|leave)(?:From|To)?=\\s*(?:\"|')([^(?:\"|')]*)"
  ]
}
```

I know, **regex is hard**, so heres a repo containing multiple use cases.

I encourage you to contribute if there are any other use cases that haven't been listed.
Thank you :)
