## Background

As I was setting up my Node server in a VPS, I got confused as to why my cookies weren't being set.
After some time I figured out that it works in the `development` environment, but not in the `production` environment.
I kept prodding around to find out that when I set the `secure` option to true the cookies weren't being sent.

> Note: I'm using express-sessions my code roughly looks like this.

```ts{10}
app.use(
  session({
    secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET as string,
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    name: 'sid',
    store: new RedisStore({ client: redisClient }),
    proxy: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    cookie: {
      httpOnly: true,
      secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
      maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365, // 1 year
    },
  })
);
```

After hours of fiddling, researching, failing, and _crying_, I **finally** found the solution.

## The Solution

Apparently, you need to add the directive `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;` to your nginx file.

For example:

```nginx{8}
location / {
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;

    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4000/;
	proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
}
```

And that's it! So much confusion just for one line.

## Conclusion

I mainly wrote this article out of frustration of the hours spent, hoping someone else won't go through that.
